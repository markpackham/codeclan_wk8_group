### Educational Geography App

Brief:

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.



#### MVP

* Home page to have regions(aka continents) > sub regions > list of countries displayed relevant to that subregion > country clicked brings up modal with additional info.

* Modal to display each country's info

* Each country has flag as icon

* Each country displays certain info: capital, etc.

* Accessing different endpoints of the API for different regions to minimise latency (reduce calling on the server)



#### Possible Extensions

* Vue Leaflet to add Maps

* Search bar on home page?

* Separate Fun Fact feature - created our own db with a certain number of facts that can be randomised and give the user the option to save the ones they like (Use a compass database to create the list so we can add facts with little issue).

* Separate quiz feature - name the country by flag, capital? (picked by continent or whole world?)
